# *info* Theme for HEXO

A theme for [hexo](https://hexo.io/), ~~a copyüê± of iA.net, hopefully.~~  **INSPIRED** by [iA.net](https://ia.net). Written by [zhao-robert](https://github.com/zhao-robert/) with [LOVE‚ù§Ô∏è](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love)~

## Why this exists?

- I love the design of [iA's Website](https://ia.net).

- And [iA's Website](https://ia.net) seems simple enough for me, who had never written something like this.
- I need a theme for my [personal website](https://yanbo.site).
